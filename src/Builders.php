 * builders: composer, npm and cargo already do that, and reimplementing them badly is
 * not the product. A builder has to already be present — checked out, symlinked,
 * downloaded by a script, copied in by hand; the framework's only interest is that the
 * executable is there. See docs/PROTOCOL.md.
 *
 * Three places, in order: an explicit path, the project's builders directory, then
 * PATH. When none of them has it the error names all three, because "builder not found"
 * without saying where it looked is the least useful thing a build can say.
