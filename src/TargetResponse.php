/**
 * What a target produces: files to sign, or the reasons it could not.
 *
 * Errors are a list rather than an exception because the convention everywhere else in
 * the pipeline is that problems accumulate and get reported together. A target that
 * gives up on the first bad config key makes the caller run the build once per
 * mistake.
 *
 * The header style travels with the response rather than being asked for separately,
 * so that one call yields everything needed to write the files — which is what the
 * out-of-process protocol will hand back as one JSON document.
 *
 * So do the extensions the target owns. Writing a tree means deleting what the schema
 * no longer produces, and a target that cannot say what is its to delete either leaves
 * stale files behind or reaches into another target's. Declaring it is also the safer
 * default when an output directory is misconfigured: a target that owns `php` cannot
 * delete someone's notes.
