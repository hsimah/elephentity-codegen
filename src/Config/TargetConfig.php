 * One target's block from eleph.json.

 * `output` and `builder` are read here because the core has to know where to write, what
 * to diff, and which program to run. Everything else stays in `settings`, uninspected:
 * what `typeNamespace` means is a property of the PHP target, and a core that learned it
 * would have moved the coupling rather than removed it. See docs/PROTOCOL.md.
 *
 * **Every target names a builder.** Elephentity generates nothing itself — there is no
 * built-in target to fall back to — so a target without one is a target nothing can
 * produce, and saying so when the config loads beats discovering it mid-build.
