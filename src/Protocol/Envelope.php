/**
 * What travels between the orchestrator and a builder, from the orchestrator's end.
 *
 * The envelope is the metadata *about* the payload: which protocol, which IR version,
 * which target, what it was configured with. The payload is `schema`. That separation
 * is the whole point — a builder reads `irVersion` and decides whether it can proceed
 * without ever having parsed an entity. Put the version inside the IR and a builder has
 * to parse the IR to discover whether it can parse the IR.
 *
 * Only half the exchange is here: this side writes requests and reads responses. The
 * other half — reading a request, writing a response — belongs to each builder, in
 * whatever language it is written. That the two halves are separate implementations of
 * one documented format, rather than one shared library, is what makes it a protocol.
 * See docs/PROTOCOL.md.
 *
 * **The envelope's own shape is frozen.** It may gain optional fields and nothing else.
 * It is what both sides must agree on before anything else can be negotiated, so it
 * cannot itself be negotiable.
